# Gameshot
PROG 5 

My project plan was building an webapp to share game screenshots. I called it Gameshot.
The goal is to create a social media for gamers. They can share their in-game memory here using screenshots.
                        
The goal is that people share their screenshots with game and genre tags. By doing this you can filter posts
on game title and genre.  

Their needed to be different rolls. So i decided that there are users and admins. The admins are here to insure
that the platform is not miss used. The admin can also add new games and tags to the platform. And users can not edit
other users post. If that happens the admin is there to fix this problem.

An other part of the project is to create an log in and registration system. This also includes validation.
 
Users can create, change, remove and hide posts. They can also like posts. After liking five posts they can
even comment on posts.
